# GithubAPICall

The main class is in the file "APICall.java file". I have used Intellij and JAVA language for writing the program. You will see "conf.properties" file in the java folder. In this properties file you change the "language" and the output path of the file and run the program. The output can be viewed in "output.json" and can be opened in Notepad++ in JSON format.
